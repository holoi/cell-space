# Cell Space 

We write a customized Voronoi generator plugin in `Packages/com.holoi.vorogen`.

Open `CellSpace_Basic.scene`, in `VoronoiGenerator`, you can adjust `offset` and `bounds`.
You can move and adjust all objects in `VoronoiSites` by tuning the position of players and the scale of the objects (weights).

`AssigningObjectAsVoronoiSite` can assign all objects under `target` as sites for Voronoi Generator.

`AssigningPlayerAsVoronoiSite` can assign all multiplayer's position as sites for Voronoi Generator.

## Overview

This repository provides sample projects illustrating the integration of the Immersal SDK with the [HoloKit SDK](https://github.com/holoi/holokit-unity-sdk) in Unity. While the Immersal SDK offers localization features, the HoloKit SDK brings to the table stereoscopic rendering and interaction capabilities.

This repository includes two distinct sample scenes:

1. **Stereo Rendering Sample**: Demonstrates the integration of HoloKit SDK's stereoscopic rendering with the Immersal SDK.

3. **Multiplayer AR Sample**: Showcases how to set up a multiplayer AR session using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects package with the [MultipperConnecvitity transport](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer-community-contributions/tree/main/Transports/com.community.netcode.transport.multipeer-connectivity).

## Compatibility

This project was built with Unity 2022.3.7f1.

## Building the Sample Scenes 

### Stereo Rendering

- **Location**: Navigate to `Assets/HoloKit Sample Scenes/Immersal_HoloKit_StereoRendering.unity`.
  
- **Setup**:
    - Download your specific Immersal map file from the Immersal Developer Portal.
    - Import the map into your Unity project.
    - Drag and drop the map file onto the `Map File` slot of the `ARMap` GameObject present in the scene.

   Before building, ensure that `Immersal_HoloKit_StereoRendering` is the sole selected scene for build.

### Multiplayer AR

- **Location**: Navigate to `Assets/HoloKit Sample Scenes/Immersal_HoloKit_MultiplayerAR.unity`.

- **Setup**:
    - As before, download your Immersal map file from the Immersal Developer Portal.
    - Import it into Unity.
    - Drag and position the map file in the `Map File` slot of the `ARMap` GameObject in the scene.

   When building, ensure `Immersal_HoloKit_MultiplayerAR` is the only selected scene.
