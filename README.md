# Immersal HoloKit Samples

This repo was forked from [Immersal SDK Samples](https://github.com/immersal/immersal-sdk-samples). It demonstrates how to use Immersal SDK together with HoloKit SDK in Unity, where Immersal SDK provides the localization functionality and HoloKti SDk provides the stereoscopic rendering and interaction functionalities.

There are 2 sample scenes in this repo, the `Immersal_HoloKit_StereoRendering` sample scene shows how to integrate the stereoscopic rendering feature of HoloKit SDK into Immersal SDK Samples.

The `Immersal_HoloKit_MultiplayerAR` sample scene illustrates how to build a multiplayer AR session with Unity's Netcode For GameObjects package using the MultipperConnecvitity transport.
